# Backward/Forward LET — Manual Recovery Procedure

This document describes the steps for recovering from a backward/forward LET divergence
when the aggsender database is empty or has been wiped. In this situation the tool cannot
fetch bridge exits from the aggsender RPC and instead needs the data extracted directly
from the agglayer node.

It also covers the post-drill startup failure where aggsender's local DB still points to
an older or different certificate while AggLayer has already settled a further one. That
startup check is intentionally strict: wipe the aggsender DB and restart aggsender rather
than expecting it to auto-reconcile.

---

## Prerequisites

- The agglayer node must have `debug-mode = true` in its configuration.
  In the op-pp E2E environment this is already set (`debug-mode = true` in
  `test/e2e/envs/op-pp/config/agglayer/config.toml`).
- The agglayer admin JSON-RPC API must be reachable (default port 4446).
  The URL is exposed as `agglayer.services.admin_api.external` in `summary.json`.
- In some staging environments the admin API is protected by IAP or another identity
  layer rather than being directly reachable on `localhost:4446`. In that case, obtain
  the required bearer token first and pass it with the request headers when calling
  `admin_getCertificate`.
- `curl` and `jq` must be installed on the operator's machine (`jq` is optional but
  makes the JSON manipulation much more convenient).

If the immediate goal is to recover aggsender itself after a staged malicious-cert drill,
stop here and wipe the aggsender DB first. The mismatch is not repaired in place.

---

## Step 1 — Run the tool to discover missing cert IDs

```bash
backward-forward-let --cfg aggkit-config.toml
```

When the aggsender DB is empty the tool prints an actionable report:

```
WARNING: Aggsender RPC returned no bridge exit data for the following certificate heights.
Recovery cannot proceed until this data is provided.

Missing certificates (2 heights):
  Height 3  CertID: 0xabc123...def456  [ID auto-resolved]
  Height 2  CertID: UNKNOWN            [contact agglayer admin for cert ID]
```

- **`[ID auto-resolved]`** — the tool resolved the cert ID from the agglayer gRPC. You can
  call `admin_getCertificate` directly in Step 2.
- **`UNKNOWN`** — the cert ID could not be resolved automatically (only the latest settled
  height is resolvable via the public gRPC). The agglayer admin must look up
  `(network_id, height)` in the `certificate_per_network_cf` column family of the agglayer
  state DB and supply the cert ID manually before you can proceed.

---

## Step 2 — Fetch each certificate from the agglayer admin API

For each cert ID printed by the tool, call `admin_getCertificate`:

```bash
AGGLAYER_ADMIN="http://localhost:4446"
CERT_ID="0xabc123...def456"

curl -s -X POST "$AGGLAYER_ADMIN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"admin_getCertificate\",\"params\":[\"$CERT_ID\"],\"id\":1}" \
  | jq '.'
```

The response is a JSON-RPC result where `result` is a two-element array
`[Certificate, CertificateHeader|null]`:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": [
    {
      "network_id": 1,
      "height": 3,
      "bridge_exits": [ ... ],
      ...
    },
    { ... }
  ]
}
```

You need `result[0].bridge_exits` from each response.

If the admin API requires a bearer token, include it explicitly:

```bash
JWT="..."
curl -s -X POST "$AGGLAYER_ADMIN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" \
  -d "{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"admin_getCertificate\",\"params\":[\"$CERT_ID\"],\"id\":1}" \
  | jq '.'
```

---

## Step 3 — Build the JSON override file

### Field name note

The override file uses the **Go `json` tag names** from `agglayertypes.BridgeExit`:

| Go field             | JSON key               |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| `LeafType`           | `leaf_type`            |
| `TokenInfo`          | `token_info`           |
| `DestinationNetwork` | `dest_network`         |
| `DestinationAddress` | `dest_address`         |
| `Amount`             | `amount` (decimal string) |
| `Metadata`           | `metadata` (base64 or null) |

The agglayer Rust serde may use different field names (e.g., `destination_network`
instead of `dest_network`). **Do not paste the raw `jq` output directly** unless you
have verified the field names match. The safest approach is to let Go do the translation
by using a small helper script (see below).

### Option A — Shell script (single cert, no Go tooling)

Verify that the field names in the admin API response match the table above before using
this option. If they do, you can pipe the `bridge_exits` array straight into the file:

```bash
AGGLAYER_ADMIN="http://localhost:4446"
CERT_ID="0xabc123...def456"
HEIGHT=3
NETWORK_ID=1

BRIDGE_EXITS=$(curl -s -X POST "$AGGLAYER_ADMIN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"admin_getCertificate\",\"params\":[\"$CERT_ID\"],\"id\":1}" \
  | jq '.result[0].bridge_exits')

cat > certificate_exits_override.json <<EOF
{
  "network_id": $NETWORK_ID,
  "description": "Extracted from agglayer admin_getCertificate on $(date -u)",
  "heights": {
    "$HEIGHT": $BRIDGE_EXITS
  }
}
EOF
```

For multiple heights, collect each `bridge_exits` array and combine them:

```bash
HEIGHT_3=$(curl -s ... | jq '.result[0].bridge_exits')
HEIGHT_2=$(curl -s ... | jq '.result[0].bridge_exits')

cat > certificate_exits_override.json <<EOF
{
  "network_id": 1,
  "description": "Extracted from agglayer admin_getCertificate on $(date -u)",
  "heights": {
    "3": $HEIGHT_3,
    "2": $HEIGHT_2
  }
}
EOF
```

### Option B — Go round-trip (recommended when field names are uncertain)

Unmarshal the admin API response into `agglayertypes.Certificate` and re-marshal
`BridgeExits` using Go's json tags. This is what the E2E test (`TestBackwardForwardLET_AggsenderAPIFallback`)
does automatically. For a standalone operator script the pattern is:

```go
// Pseudo-code — adapt to your own tooling
response := jsonrpcCall(adminURL, "admin_getCertificate", certID)
var pair [2]json.RawMessage
json.Unmarshal(response.Result, &pair)
var cert agglayertypes.Certificate
json.Unmarshal(pair[0], &cert)

// cert.BridgeExits now uses Go field values regardless of Rust serde names.
data, _ := json.Marshal(overrideFileJSON{
    NetworkID: networkID,
    Heights:   map[string][]*agglayertypes.BridgeExit{
        strconv.FormatUint(height, 10): cert.BridgeExits,
    },
})
os.WriteFile("certificate_exits_override.json", data, 0o600)
```

---

## Step 4 — Re-run the tool with the override file

```bash
backward-forward-let --cfg aggkit-config.toml \
  --cert-exits-file certificate_exits_override.json
```

The `-f` short alias also works:

```bash
backward-forward-let --cfg aggkit-config.toml -f certificate_exits_override.json
```

The tool will:
1. Load bridge exits from the override file for any height where the aggsender RPC fails.
2. Complete the divergence walk using the combined data.
3. Print the full diagnosis (case classification, divergent leaves, extra L2 bridges).
4. Prompt for confirmation, then execute the recovery plan.

Operational notes:

- When aggsender is intentionally stopped for a fallback drill, the missing-height report
  may span the full settled history rather than only the newest malicious certificate.
  This is expected.
- You can build the override file incrementally as more certificates settle. Reuse the
  same file on later diagnosis reruns, and also pass it to `craft-cert` if a later
  malicious certificate must be built while aggsender is still unavailable.

---

## Heights with UNKNOWN cert IDs

When the tool reports `CertID: UNKNOWN` for a height, the agglayer admin must:

1. Open the agglayer state DB (RocksDB).
2. Look up the key `(network_id, height)` in the `certificate_per_network_cf` column family
   to retrieve the `CertificateId`.
3. Call `admin_getCertificate` with that ID and provide `result[0].bridge_exits` to the
   operator.
4. The operator includes the exits for that height in the override file alongside any
   auto-resolved heights and re-runs the tool.

Only the latest settled height is auto-resolvable via the public agglayer gRPC. All
earlier heights require this manual lookup when the aggsender DB is absent.

---

## Aggsender startup mismatch after a drill

Symptom:

- aggsender restart loops with a startup consistency error saying the local certificate
  differs from, or is behind, the latest AggLayer certificate.

Meaning:

- this is intentional behavior,
- aggsender does not treat AggLayer as a source of truth for overwriting local DB state,
- the local DB must be cleared manually before aggsender can rebuild and continue.

Operator action:

1. Stop aggsender.
2. Wipe the aggsender DB used for local certificate tracking.
3. Restart aggsender.
4. Confirm it rebuilds state from the live network and resumes honest certificate
   production.

## Override file format reference

```json
{
  "network_id": 1,
  "description": "optional human-readable note",
  "heights": {
    "3": [
      {
        "leaf_type": 0,
        "token_info": {
          "origin_network": 0,
          "origin_token_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
        },
        "dest_network": 1,
        "dest_address": "0xAbCd...1234",
        "amount": "1000000000000000000",
        "metadata": null
      }
    ],
    "2": []
  }
}
```

Key constraints enforced by the loader:

- `network_id` must be non-zero.
- `heights` must be present (even if empty).
- Height keys must be non-negative decimal integers (e.g., `"0"`, `"3"`).
- `amount` is a decimal string (matching Go `*big.Int` JSON marshaling).
- `metadata` is `null` for empty/nil; base64-encoded for non-empty byte slices.
- Field names must use Go json tags (`dest_network`, `dest_address`), not Rust serde names.
